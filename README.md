### MLND PROJECT 1 -  Predicting Boston Housing Prices

This is a repository with the submission files for Project 1 of Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree


>**Note:** This repo was created after the submissions. I still submited through file upload during the project's evaluation. But then decided to create this and start using GitHub evaluation for the next projects.

This are the links to Udacity's reviews (only the last one met the project specifications)
